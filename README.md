ShimCity Times Directory + Branding Scheme

Solves: ("Make a directory to find out which reporters are assigned to which division.") for ShimCity Times Inc. by Shimran George

Written in Javascript with AngularJS.

Functionality:

The purpose of this app is to create a directory sorting all reporters working for the ShimCity Times into their respective divisions. Reporters and Divisions can be added dynamically, and each reporter has the properties of length of service and birthday associated with them.


Users can also dynamically edit the Divisions.

Tools for Functionality:

1) Add angular-ui-router.js and angular.js files

2) Run the python -m SimpleHTTPServer in Terminal and it will load the files at address localhost:8000

3) Navigate to localhost:8000 on your browser.

Future Functionality:

This app is a work in progress. Currently the ShimCity Times directory does not allow for the editing or deleting of reporters should they get fired, or moved on to another job. This will be added in the future. Similarly Divisions cannot be deleted in the event of downsizing. Additionally, with the lack of databases or connection to an external server, the directory will disappear at the shutdown of the simple server.

Articles each reporter wrote will be featured in their profile, along with links to all of them, with a date timestamp.
